			<u>Student-Teacher Interaction Time Increases </u>
		</h2>
		<p>
			<i>There is something I fundamentally believe about good teaching – it is about developing good relationships between the teacher and the student.  One of the beauties of the Flipped Classroom is that it gives the teacher more individual time with each student.  That means your son or daughter will get more one-on-one time with his/her teacher.  There is something powerful about moving the teacher away from the “front of the room.”   Getting teachers in-and-amongst their students changes the dynamics of the class.  When we flipped our classes in 2007, I knew my students better than I had in my previous 19 years as a teacher. Spending lots of quality time with each child helped me to know my students better both cognitively and relationally</i>

			<u>Flipped Classes lead your child to deeper learning</u>
		</h2>
		<p>
			<i>There is one thing I have seen happen with almost every teacher who has flipped their classroom.  They flip their classroom for about one to two years and then they go beyond the flipped classroom to deeper learning strategies.  These include things like Project Based Learning, Challenge Based Learning, and Mastery Learning.  Count yourself extremely fortunate if you have a teacher who has flipped their class for multiple years.  These teachers have no doubt completely changed the dynamic of their classrooms.  Instead of being focused on test preparation or busy work, their students are actively engaged in their own learning, taking responsibility for their learning, and enthusiastically embracing learning</i>
